We assess AI maturity across operations, marketing, and digital, then implement high-ROI workflows, automation systems, and growth infrastructure.

## Additional Notes
Blackwell Digital is not a traditional web agency. This website must position us as a premium AI-driven business systems consultancy, not a design shop.

Key requirements:

• Clearly articulate the AI Maturity framework and offer ladder.
• Focus messaging on measurable business leverage — revenue growth, operational efficiency, reduced chaos.
• Make the AI Maturity Assessment (QuickScan) the central conversion engine.
• Structure content for both traditional SEO and AI-powered search extraction (clear H1/H2, concise answers, Q&A sections, schema).
• Follow a pillar + cluster content model aligned to buyer intent.
• Design should feel premium, strategic, and modern — closer to high-end consulting than marketing agency.
• Every service must tie to measurable KPIs.
• Compete on clarity, speed, and execution — not enterprise size.

Avoid:
• Buzzword-heavy AI hype
• Commodity agency positioning
• “We build websites” framing
• Overly technical jargon

The site should function as a strategic operating system for growth — not a brochure.
