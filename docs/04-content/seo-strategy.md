# SEO Strategy — Blackwell Digital Website
**Project:** blackwell-digital-website
**Agent:** ORION SEO Strategy
**Generated:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** Draft

## Keyword Strategy

### Keyword Research Philosophy

Blackwell Digital operates in a legitimately underserved niche: premium AI transformation consulting for SMBs doing $1M–$25M in revenue. The enterprise consultancies (Deloitte, Accenture) own broad "AI consulting" terms with enormous domain authority. The strategic opportunity is to own the SMB-specific, framework-specific, and regional long-tail where competition is minimal and buyer intent is high.

Target a three-tier approach: (1) high-intent local/regional terms with low competition, (2) framework-specific terms Blackwell can own outright, and (3) educational/diagnostic terms aligned to buyer journey.

---

### Primary Keywords (7)

These are the terms every core page is optimized toward. Realistic ranking potential within 6–12 months.

| # | Keyword | Est. Monthly Volume | Difficulty | Priority |
|---|---------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| 1 | AI consulting for small business | 400–800 | Medium | High |
| 2 | AI transformation consultancy | 200–400 | Medium | High |
| 3 | business automation consultant | 300–600 | Medium | High |
| 4 | AI maturity assessment | 150–300 | Low | High |
| 5 | AI consultant Central Illinois | 50–100 | Very Low | High |
| 6 | AI consultant St. Louis | 100–200 | Low | High |
| 7 | small business AI implementation | 200–500 | Medium | High |

**Rationale:** Volumes are intentionally modest — these are qualified, commercial-intent searches from the exact buyer persona Blackwell serves. A visitor searching "AI maturity assessment" or "AI consultant Central Illinois" is worth 100× a generic "AI" search visitor. Prioritize quality over volume.

---

### Long-Tail Keyword Opportunities

These terms are low-volume but extremely high-intent. Many are zero-competition because Blackwell's framework vocabulary is proprietary. Owning these terms means owning the category.

**Framework-Specific (Blackwell can dominate these outright)**
- "AI maturity QuickScan" — owns the brand term before anyone else can
- "AI maturity stage 1 2 3 4" — framework educational content

- "assisted vs automated business AI" — framework stage comparison
- "AI-first operating system for business" — product-term ownership

- "AI Growth System 90 days" — product-term ownership

**Buyer-Pain Long-Tails (matching how prospects describe their problem)**
- "how to reduce manual processes in small business"
- "how to connect marketing and operations systems"
- "CRM not working small business"
- "marketing not generating leads small business"
- "how to scale without hiring more people"

**Industry-Specific Long-Tails**
- "AI automation for professional services firm"

**Geographic Long-Tails**
- "AI business consultant Bloomington Illinois"

- "digital transformation consultant Central Illinois"
- "AI consulting firms Illinois"

**Question-Based (AI Overview / Featured Snippet targets)**

- "what is the difference between AI tools and AI systems"
- "how long does AI implementation take for a small business"

## On-Page SEO Plan

### Homepage (`/`)

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Title Tag** | AI Transformation for Growth-Stage Businesses — Blackwell Digital |
| **Characters** | 57 |
| **Meta Description** | Blackwell Digital helps $1M–$25M businesses implement AI-driven operations, marketing systems, and growth infrastructure. Take the free AI Maturity QuickScan. |
| **Characters** | 157 |
| **H1** | Your Business Runs on Systems. We Make Them Intelligent. |
| **H2s** | "Built for Businesses Like Yours" / "Three Tiers. One Clear Path Forward." / "Where Does Your Business Fall?" / "Know Your Starting Point in 10 Minutes" / "Stop Guessing. Start Measuring." |
| **Primary Keyword** | AI transformation consultancy |
| **Secondary Keywords** | AI consulting for small business, small business AI implementation, AI digital transformation SMB, business automation consultant |
| **Image Alt Text** | Hero background: "executive reviewing AI transformation dashboard" / Service cards: "Foundation Sprint AI consulting service overview" / Framework: "AI maturity framework four stages diagram" |
| **Internal Linking Targets** | → /quickscan (QuickScan CTA), → /framework (framework teaser), → /services (service cards), → /results (case study cards), → /insights (blog previews), → /contact (strategy call CTA) |
| **Internal Link Anchor Text** | "Take the QuickScan" / "Discover Your Maturity Stage" / "View All Services" / "Read the Full Story" / "Book a Strategy Call" |

**Notes:** Embed FAQ schema on the homepage for the "Where Does Your Business Fall?" section. Ensure metrics strip (47%, 3.2×, etc.) is marked up as visible body text — not hidden in CSS — for crawlability. The hero H1 is brand-forward; support it with keyword-rich H2s deeper on the page.

---

### AI Maturity QuickScan Landing (`/quickscan`)

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Title Tag** | Free AI Maturity Assessment for Small Business — Blackwell Digital |
| **Characters** | 58 |
| **Meta Description** | Take the free AI Maturity QuickScan to score your business across operations, marketing, and digital. Get your maturity stage and personalized action plan in 10 minutes. |
| **Characters** | 160 |
| **H1** | Find Out Where Your Business Actually Stands on AI |
| **H2s** | "What You'll Get From Your QuickScan" / "Three Steps. Ten Minutes. Total Clarity." / "Here's What Your Results Look Like" / "Is the QuickScan Right for You?" / "Ready to See Where You Stand?" |
| **Primary Keyword** | AI readiness assessment tool |
| **Secondary Keywords** | business AI assessment free, AI maturity assessment, AI maturity model SMB |
| **Image Alt Text** | Sample result preview: "AI maturity QuickScan sample results showing stage score and dimension breakdown" |
| **Internal Linking Targets** | → /framework (maturity stage explanation), → /services (service tier descriptions), → /quickscan/assessment (CTA) |
| **Internal Link Anchor Text** | "Learn about the four maturity stages" / "Explore our service tiers" / "Start the Assessment" |

**Notes:** Add FAQPage schema to the "Is the QuickScan Right for You?" and any FAQ-pattern blocks. Add HowTo schema to the "Three Steps" block. Include canonical pointing to `/quickscan` (not the assessment or results subdirectories).

---

### QuickScan Assessment (`/quickscan/assessment`)

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Title Tag** | AI Maturity QuickScan — Assessment — Blackwell Digital |
| **Meta Description** | Complete your AI Maturity QuickScan. Answer 8–12 questions about your operations, marketing, and digital presence. |
| **Robots** | `noindex, nofollow` |
| **H1** | AI Maturity QuickScan |
| **Primary Keyword** | (noindex — no target) |
| **Canonical** | Self-referencing; `noindex` renders canonical moot but include for consistency |

**Notes:** This page must never be indexed. Every step/question view is a JavaScript state change — not a separate URL — to avoid thin content pages. Ensure the progress indicator is accessible with `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, `aria-valuenow` on the progress bar.

---

### QuickScan Results (`/quickscan/results/[token]`)

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Title Tag** | Your AI Maturity Results — Blackwell Digital |
| **Meta Description** | *(Not applicable — noindex)* |
| **Robots** | `noindex, nofollow` |
| **H1** | Your AI Maturity Stage: [Stage Name] |
| **Primary Keyword** | (noindex — no target) |
| **Canonical** | Self-referencing; `noindex` in effect |
| **OG Tags** | Generate dynamic Open Graph tags per token for "Share Your Results" functionality |

**Notes:** Results pages are private and must be noindexed. However, the shareable URL function requires properly formatted Open Graph meta tags so that when users share their results link socially, it renders a meaningful preview card (e.g., "Stage 2: Assisted — See your full AI Maturity Report"). Generate these server-side per token.

---

### Services Overview (`/services`)

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Title Tag** | AI Consulting Services for Small Business — Blackwell Digital |
| **Characters** | 56 |
| **Meta Description** | Three structured AI transformation service tiers for businesses ready to implement AI — from a 4-week Foundation Sprint to a full AI-First Operating System. Find your fit. |
| **Characters** | 160 |
| **H1** | Structured AI Engagements. Measurable Outcomes. |
| **H2s** | "One Path. Three Entry Points." / "Which Tier Fits?" / "How Every Engagement Works" / "Not Sure Which Tier Fits?" |
| **Primary Keyword** | workflow automation consulting |
| **Secondary Keywords** | business process automation consulting, AI consulting for small business, AI digital transformation SMB |
| **Image Alt Text** | Offer ladder diagram: "Three-tier AI consulting offer ladder — Foundation Sprint, AI Growth System, AI-First Operating System" |
| **Internal Linking Targets** | → /services/foundation-sprint, → /services/ai-growth-system, → /services/ai-first-operating-system, → /quickscan, → /contact |
| **Internal Link Anchor Text** | "View Foundation Sprint Details" / "View AI Growth System Details" / "View AI-First Operating System Details" / "Take the QuickScan" / "Book a Strategy Call" |

**Notes:** Add Service schema (or ItemList schema) for the three service tiers. The comparison table is high-value for featured snippets — ensure it renders as a semantic `<table>` with `<th>` headers, not a CSS-only grid layout. Add FAQPage schema to "Not Sure Which Tier Fits?" block.

---

### Foundation Sprint (`/services/foundation-sprint`)

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Title Tag** | Foundation Sprint — 4-Week AI Assessment & Implementation — Blackwell Digital |
| **Characters** | 60 |
| **Meta Description** | The Foundation Sprint is a 4-week AI consulting engagement that maps your workflows, identifies high-ROI automation opportunities, and delivers your first working AI automations. |
| **Characters** | 159 |
| **H1** | Foundation Sprint: Clarity and Quick Wins in 4 Weeks |
| **H2s** | "The Problem This Solves" / "What You Get" / "What Clients Measure After a Foundation Sprint" / "How the 4 Weeks Break Down" / "Who This Is For" / "Investment" / "Common Questions About the Foundation Sprint" |
| **Primary Keyword** | business process automation consulting |
| **Secondary Keywords** | operations automation consulting, AI workflow assessment, small business AI implementation |
| **Long-Tail Target** | "4-week AI assessment and implementation for small business" |
| **Image Alt Text** | Timeline diagram: "Foundation Sprint 4-week engagement timeline — discovery, workflow mapping, implementation, handoff" |
| **Internal Linking Targets** | → /services (services overview), → /quickscan (pre-qualification CTA), → /framework (maturity stage context), → /contact (strategy call), → /results/[foundation-sprint-case-study] |
| **Internal Link Anchor Text** | "Back to All Services" / "Take the QuickScan First" / "Understand Your Maturity Stage" / "Book Your Strategy Call" / "Read the Full Case Study" |

**Notes:** FAQPage schema on the "Common Questions" block. Add breadcrumb schema: Home > Services > Foundation Sprint. The deliverables list (bullet points) is strong for featured snippet capture — format as a clean `<ul>` with descriptive items. The KPI block ("15–25 hours/week reclaimed") should be in body text, not hidden in decorative elements.

---

### AI Growth System (`/services/ai-growth-system`)

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Title Tag** | AI Growth System — 90-Day Marketing & Operations Integration — Blackwell Digital |
| **Characters** | 60 |
| **Meta Description** | Build AI-driven marketing and operations systems in 90 days. The AI Growth System integrates lead generation, scoring, and fulfillment workflows without adding headcount. |

| **Primary Keyword** | AI workflow automation for SMB |
| **Secondary Keywords** | marketing automation consultant, operations automation consulting, AI digital transformation SMB |
| **Long-Tail Target** | "90-day AI marketing and operations system for growing businesses" |
| **Image Alt Text** | 90-day timeline: "AI Growth System 90-day engagement timeline — discovery, build, deploy, optimize" |
| **Internal Linking Targets** | → /services (overview), → /services/foundation-sprint (if not ready for this tier), → /services/ai-first-operating-system (next tier up), → /quickscan, → /contact |
| **Internal Link Anchor Text** | "Not sure which tier fits? Start with the Foundation Sprint" / "Ready for full transformation? See the AI-First Operating System" / "Take the QuickScan" / "Book Your Strategy Call" |

**Notes:** FAQPage schema on "Common Questions" block. Breadcrumb schema: Home > Services > AI Growth System. The KPI block (3.2×, 60%, 40%) is a strong featured snippet candidate — render as visible, crawlable text. The cross-linking between service pages is critical for internal equity distribution and buyer journey navigation.

---

### AI-First Operating System (`/services/ai-first-operating-system`)

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Title Tag** | AI-First Operating System — Full Business Transformation — Blackwell Digital |
| **Characters** | 57 |
| **Meta Description** | The AI-First Operating System is a 6-month engagement that rewires operations, marketing, and digital infrastructure into a unified AI-driven system for growing businesses. |

| **Primary Keyword** | AI-first operating model |
| **Secondary Keywords** | small business AI implementation, AI digital transformation SMB, business automation consultant |
| **Long-Tail Target** | "full business AI transformation consulting for companies $5M–$25M" |
| **Image Alt Text** | 6-month roadmap: "AI-First Operating System 6-month transformation timeline by function" |
| **Internal Linking Targets** | → /services, → /services/ai-growth-system, → /framework, → /results, → /contact |
| **Internal Link Anchor Text** | "See All Services" / "Compare with the AI Growth System" / "Understand the AI Maturity Framework" / "See Client Results" / "Book Your Strategy Call" |

**Notes:** FAQPage schema on "Common Questions" block. Breadcrumb schema: Home > Services > AI-First Operating System. The multi-location FAQ answer is a strong local SEO signal — keep it in natural-language body text. The $240K+ savings figure and 47% reduction are strong for featured snippets; ensure they appear in crawlable body copy.

---

### AI Maturity Framework (`/framework`)

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Title Tag** | AI Maturity Framework for Small Business — Blackwell Digital |
| **Characters** | 55 |
| **Meta Description** | The AI Maturity Framework maps your business to one of four stages — Manual, Assisted, Automated, or Autonomous — across operations, marketing, and digital. Free assessment included. |
| **Characters** | 160 |
| **H1** | The AI Maturity Framework |
| **H2s** | "Why AI Maturity Matters More Than AI Tools" / "Stage 1: Manual" / "Stage 2: Assisted" / "Stage 3: Automated" / "Stage 4: Autonomous" / "Where Does Your Business Fall?" / "How Blackwell Uses the AI Maturity Framework" / "Frequently Asked Questions About AI Maturity" |
| **Primary Keyword** | AI maturity model SMB |
| **Secondary Keywords** | AI maturity stages, AI maturity assessment, AI readiness assessment tool, how to implement AI in your business |
| **Long-Tail Targets** | "what is AI maturity for small business" / "AI maturity stages explained" / "AI maturity framework for companies under $25M" |
| **Image Alt Text** | Framework diagram: "AI maturity framework four stages — Manual, Assisted, Automated, Autonomous — with progression path" / Stage icons: descriptive per stage |
| **Internal Linking Targets** | → /quickscan (multiple CTA placements), → /services/foundation-sprint (Stage 1 CTA), → /services/ai-growth-system (Stage 2 CTA), → /services/ai-first-operating-system (Stage 3 CTA), → /insights (related articles) |
| **Internal Link Anchor Text** | "Take the Free QuickScan" / "Learn About the Foundation Sprint" / "Learn About the AI Growth System" / "Learn About the AI-First Operating System" |

**Notes:** This is the highest-priority pillar page for SEO. Aim for 3,000–4,000 words of substantive content. FAQPage schema on the "Frequently Asked Questions" block — this is a prime candidate for AI Overviews and featured snippets. The four-stage breakdown with clear H2s for each stage is intentionally structured for featured snippet extraction. Add DefinedTerm or SpecialAnnouncement schema if applicable. The interactive diagram should have a static fallback that is fully crawlable — all stage information must exist in HTML, not just JavaScript state.

---

### Results (`/results`)

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Title Tag** | AI Consulting Results & Case Studies — Blackwell Digital |
| **Characters** | 53 |
| **Meta Description** | See how Blackwell Digital clients measure AI transformation success. Real case studies, real KPIs, and real business outcomes for companies doing $1M–$25M in revenue. |

| **Internal Linking Targets** | → /results/[case-study-slug] (each card), → /contact, → /quickscan, → /services |
| **Internal Link Anchor Text** | "Read Case Study" / "Book a Strategy Call" / "Take the QuickScan" / "Explore Our Services" |

**Notes:** Add ItemList schema listing available case studies. Each case study card should link with descriptive anchor text including the industry and result. As case studies are added over time, this page compounds in authority. The filter controls (industry/tier/challenge) must be accessible — keyboard-navigable with `role="listbox"` or native `<select>` patterns.

---

### Individual Case Study (`/results/[slug]`)

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Title Tag Pattern** | [Result] — [Industry] [Company Type] Case Study — Blackwell Digital |

| **Schema** | Article schema + BreadcrumbList |
| **Internal Linking Targets** | → /results (back to all results), → /services/[relevant-tier], → /framework, → /contact |

**Notes:** Breadcrumb schema: Home > Results > [Case Study Title]. Mark up key metrics (52%, $310K, etc.) with visible body text — not pulled from CSS counters. Each case study is a standalone SEO asset — ensure the title tag includes both the result and the industry for maximum keyword coverage.

---

## Technical SEO Requirements

### Schema Markup Recommendations

Implement all schema as JSON-LD in `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags. Do not use Microdata or RDFa. Next.js: render schema server-side via `generateMetadata` or include in Server Component `<head>` output.

#### Organization Schema (Site-Wide — in `<head>` on every page)

```json

### Canonical URL Strategy

**Rules:**
- Every indexable page includes a self-referencing canonical `<link rel="canonical" href="https://blackwelldigital.com/[path]" />`
- HTTPS, non-www is the canonical format (or www — choose one and enforce it with a 301 redirect for all variations)
- Trailing slash: choose one convention (no trailing slash recommended for Next.js App Router) and enforce via redirect
- `/quickscan/assessment` → `noindex` + canonical to self (no SEO value, should not be indexed)
- `/quickscan/results/[token]` → `noindex` + canonical to self (user-specific, must not be indexed)
- Blog pagination: `?page=2` → canonical to self (not to page 1); use `rel="next"` / `rel="prev"` for pagination signals
- Filtered Results page views (`/results?industry=manufacturing`) → canonical to `/results` (unfiltered) to prevent duplicate indexing

**Implementation in Next.js App Router:**

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx or individual page generateMetadata
export async function generateMetadata(): Promise<Metadata> {
  return {
    alternates: {
      canonical: 'https://blackwelldigital.com/services/foundation-sprint',
    },
  }
}
```

---

### Sitemap.xml Requirements

**Location:** `https://blackwelldigital.com/sitemap.xml`
**Generation:** Build-time via Next.js `app/sitemap.ts`

**Include:**
- `/` (priority: 1.0, changefreq: weekly)
- `/quickscan` (priority: 0.9, changefreq: monthly)
- `/framework` (priority: 0.9, changefreq: monthly)
- `/services` (priority: 0.8, changefreq: monthly)
- `/services/foundation-sprint` (priority: 0.8, changefreq: monthly)
- `/services/ai-growth-system` (priority: 0.8, changefreq: monthly)
- `/services/ai-first-operating-system` (priority: 0.8, changefreq: monthly)
- `/results` (priority: 0.7, changefreq: monthly)
- `/results/[slug]` for each published case study (priority: 0.7, changefreq: rarely)
- `/about` (priority: 0.6, changefreq: rarely)
- `/contact` (priority: 0.7, changefreq: rarely)
- `/insights` (priority: 0.7, changefreq: weekly)
- `/insights/[slug]` for each published post (priority: 0.6, changefreq: rarely)

**Exclude (explicitly):**
- `/quickscan/assessment`
- `/quickscan/results/*`
- `/admin/*`
- Any staging or preview URLs
- `/api/*`
- `/404`

**Sitemap Index:** If post volume exceeds 1,000 URLs, split into sitemap index pointing to `/sitemap-core.xml` and `/sitemap-posts.xml`.

**Next.js Implementation:**

```typescript
// app/sitemap.ts
import { MetadataRoute } from 'next'

export default async function sitemap(): Promise<MetadataRoute.Sitemap> {
  const posts = await getAllPublishedPosts() // WPGraphQL fetch
  const caseStudies = await getAllCaseStudies()

  const staticPages = [
    { url: 'https://blackwelldigital.com', priority: 1.0, changeFrequency: 'weekly' as const },
    { url: 'https://blackwelldigital.com/quickscan', priority: 0.9, changeFrequency: 'monthly' as const },
    // ... all static pages
  ]

  const dynamicPosts = posts.map((post) => ({
    url: `https://blackwelldigital.com/insights/${post.slug}`,
    lastModified: post.modifiedDate,
    priority: 0.6,
    changeFrequency: 'rarely' as const,
  }))

  return [...staticPages, ...dynamicPosts, ...caseStudies]
}
```

### Robots.txt Configuration

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /

# Block private/functional paths
Disallow: /quickscan/assessment
Disallow: /quickscan/results/
Disallow: /api/
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /_next/

# Block staging environment (if staging is on same domain path — prefer subdomain instead)
# Disallow: /staging/

# GTM preview
Disallow: /gtm.js

Sitemap: https://blackwelldigital.com/sitemap.xml
```

**Staging Environment Note:** The staging/preview environment must be on a separate domain or subdomain (e.g., `staging.blackwelldigital.com`) with its own `robots.txt` containing `Disallow: /`. Do not use URL path-based staging with the production domain. The staging `robots.txt`:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

### Core Web Vitals Targets

All targets align with Blackwell Digital ORION Performance Standards (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms).

| Metric | Target | Strategy |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **LCP** | < 2.5s | Preload hero images via `<link rel="preload">`. Serve WebP via `next/image`. Self-host fonts via `next/font`. No render-blocking third-party scripts above fold. |
| **CLS** | < 0.1 | Explicit `width` and `height` on all `next/image` instances. Reserve space for dynamic content (QuickScan results, case study cards) with skeleton loaders. Avoid inserting content above existing content after load. |
| **INP** | < 200ms | Long Task budget enforced. QuickScan multi-step form uses React state (no full page navigation). Debounce any filter interactions on `/results`. Dynamic import heavy components (Calendly, chart libraries). |
| **TTFB** | < 600ms | Next.js Server Components with Vercel Edge Network. Static generation for all stable pages (homepage, services, framework). ISR for blog posts and case studies (60-second revalidation). |
| **FCP** | < 1.8s | Inline critical CSS. Defer non-critical CSS. Font-display: swap. |

**Lighthouse Targets:**
- Performance: ≥ 90
- Accessibility: ≥ 95
- Best Practices: ≥ 90
- SEO: ≥ 95

**Monitoring:**
- Lighthouse CI on every PR (GitHub Actions integration)
- Monthly manual audit via PageSpeed Insights
- Google Search Console Core Web Vitals report — review monthly
- UptimeRobot: 5-minute interval uptime monitoring

---

### Mobile Optimization Requirements

- Mobile-first design: all components functional at 320px minimum viewport
- Touch targets: minimum 44×44px for all interactive elements (CTA buttons, navigation items, FAQ toggles)
- Tap targets: 8px minimum spacing between adjacent touch targets
- QuickScan assessment: question options must be full-width touch targets on mobile — not small radio buttons
- Navigation: hamburger menu with accessible `aria-expanded` toggle; focus trap when open
- Tables (service comparison): horizontal scroll with `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`; consider card layout alternative on mobile
- Images: responsive `srcset` via `next/image` with appropriate `sizes` attribute per breakpoint
- Font sizes: minimum 16px body text; never reduce below 14px for any content (prevents iOS zoom on input focus)
- Form inputs: font-size ≥ 16px on all `<input>` and `<textarea>` fields (prevents iOS auto-zoom on focus)
- No hover-only interactions: every hover state has an equivalent tap/click behavior

---

### Local Citations

Build consistent NAP citations on the following platforms. NAP (Name, Address, Phone) must be character-for-character identical across all listings.

**Tier 1 — Priority citations (complete before launch):**
- Google Business Profile
- Bing Places for Business
- Apple Maps (via Apple Business Connect)
- Facebook Business Page

**Tier 2 — Business directories (complete within 30 days of launch):**
- Yelp (even for B2B — signals consistency)
- LinkedIn Company Page
- Clutch.co (critical for B2B consulting firms — create profile, seek reviews)
- G2 (relevant for software-adjacent consulting)
- Expertise.com (AI/tech consultants)
- Bark.com (local service businesses)

**Tier 3 — Regional directories (complete within 60 days):**
- Bloomington-Normal Chamber of Commerce (if applicable)
- Peoria Area Chamber of Commerce
- Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce
- St. Louis Regional Chamber
- Illinois Business (state business directory)

**Tier 4 — Industry directories:**
- Consulting.com directory
- The Manifest (B2B consulting directory)
- ITFirms.co
- DesignRush (digital consultancies)

**NAP Format to Use Everywhere:**

```
Blackwell Digital
[Street Address]
[City], IL [ZIP]
[Phone Number]
https://blackwelldigital.com
```

Audit citations quarterly using Moz Local or BrightLocal. Correct any inconsistencies immediately.

---

### NAP Consistency Requirements

NAP must appear in the following locations on the website, formatted identically:

1. **Footer** (site-wide) — structured as `<address>` HTML element
2. **Contact page** (`/contact`) — primary placement
3. **About page** (`/about`) — secondary placement
4. **LocalBusiness JSON-LD schema** — matches exactly
5. **Google Business Profile** — matches exactly

**HTML Implementation:**

```html
<address itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness">
  <span itemprop="name">Blackwell Digital</span>
  <span itemprop="address" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/PostalAddress">
    <span itemprop="streetAddress">[Street Address]</span>,
    <span itemprop="addressLocality">[City]</span>,
    <span itemprop="addressRegion">IL</span>
    <span itemprop="postalCode">[ZIP]</span>
  </span>
  <a href="tel:+1[phone]" itemprop="telephone">[Phone]</a>
</address>
```

---

### Local Schema Markup

Implement LocalBusiness schema on the `/contact` page with `@type: ProfessionalService` (more specific than LocalBusiness). Include `areaServed` array with Central Illinois, St. Louis, and national service areas. Full implementation is included in the Schema Markup section above.

Add `geo` coordinates matching the physical address — this is used by map-based search features.

---

### Location-Specific Landing Pages

**Recommended:** Create two geo-targeted service pages within 90 days of launch to capture regional search traffic.

**Page 1:** `/illinois/ai-consultant`
- Title: `AI Consultant Illinois — AI Transformation for Illinois Businesses — Blackwell Digital`
- Target: "AI consultant Illinois," "business automation consultant Illinois," "AI consulting firms Illinois"
- Content: Local context, regional industry focus (manufacturing, agriculture, professional services in Illinois), team connection to the region, local case studies if available

**Page 2:** `/st-louis/ai-consultant`
- Title: `AI Consultant St. Louis — AI Transformation Consulting — Blackwell Digital`
- Target: "AI consultant St. Louis," "business automation St. Louis," "digital transformation consultant St. Louis"
- Content: St. Louis regional business context, industries served in the metro, engagement delivery model

**Important:** These pages must have substantive, unique content — not duplicated service page content with city names swapped. Google penalizes thin location pages. Include at least 600 words of genuinely local-relevant content per page.

---

## Content Calendar

### Content Strategy Framework

All content follows a pillar + cluster model anchored to the AI Maturity Framework pillar page at `/framework`. Clusters branch from the pillar across three topic dimensions: AI Maturity (framework education), Operations (workflow automation), and Marketing (AI-driven growth systems).

**Content types:**
- **Long-form pillar posts** (2,500–4,000 words): Comprehensive guides targeting high-volume informational keywords
- **Cluster posts** (1,200–2,000 words): Specific, actionable content targeting long-tail keywords
- **Industry spotlights** (1,000–1,500 words): Sector-specific applications driving local and industry SEO
- **Framework-specific posts** (1,200–1,800 words): Deep dives on framework stages and concepts

**Internal linking rule:** Every cluster post links back to `/framework` (the pillar), the relevant service page, and `/quickscan`. Every post includes a QuickScan CTA mid-content and at the end.

**AI-search optimization rule:** All posts include an FAQ section (minimum 4 Q&A pairs) marked up with FAQPage schema. H2s are written as direct answer targets. Every post answers "what is," "how does," "how long does," and "how much does" variants where applicable.
